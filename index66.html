//         Conversion functions
// But what if you want the data property value for the location to be something 
// other than a Point? You can provide a conversion function that converts 
// the actual data property value to the needed value type or format.

// For situations like this example, the Point class includes a static 
// function, Point.parse, that you can use to convert a string into a Point
//  object. It expects two numbers to be in the input string, representing the
//   Point.x and Point.y values. It returns a Point object with those values.

// You can pass a conversion function as the third argument to the Binding 
// constructor. In this case it is Point.parse. This allows the location to be
//  specified in the form of a string ("100 50") rather than as an expression that 
//  returns a Point. For data properties on model objects, you will often want to use
//   strings as the representation of Points, Sizes, Rects, Margins, and Spots, rather
//    than references to objects of those classes. Strings are easily read and written 
//    in JSON and XML. Trying to read/write classes of objects would take extra space
//     and would require additional cooperation on the part of both the writer and the 
//     reader.
